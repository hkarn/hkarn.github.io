# Portfolio and CV website
My portfolio website [arnoldson.online](https://arnoldson.online) or [hkarn.github.io](https://hkarn.github.io)

The site has a simple CV as well as a showcase of some of my programming projects.

The front-end is created with create-react-app.

Back-end is just a PHP script that handles the contact form submission. 
The script checks Google Invisible reCaptcha, anti-hammering and form data before sending it with PHPMailer using either OAuth2 or just SMTP.


### Hot navigation

When pressing scrolling/sliding past the end of a page border or when pressing a arrow key the page will change accoring to the navigation arrows displayed.
The navigation arrows are also clickable as normal links.
